## Abstract
Given the concern with climate change affecting the rise of global temperatures, it is plausible that wildfires
contribute to the problem of climate change and, inversely, the increase in atmospheric temperatures
impacts the severity of wildfires. Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that will
continue to warm the planet well into the future and contribute to the ill-effects of global warming.
Additionally, smoke from wildfires causes serious health risks that can be deadly for sensitive populations
with underlying health conditions. Loss of property and financial distress is another social impact of the
wildfires occurring in residential or commercial areas (See diagram below). Hence, our capstone team is
exploring a hypothesis that data science modeling can approximate the intensity of wildfires and provide a tool for public to access this information.
## Hypothesis
We belive that Forest Fire Danger Index will be influenced by:
– Land Coverage
– Wind
– Humidity
– Temperature
And thus it is possible to predict the intensity of the fire having information about the factors above.
## Data Sources
- NASA Earth Data
- USDA Emission Data
- DarkSky API Weather Data
